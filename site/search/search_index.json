Introduction Energy landscape analysis (ELA) is a systematic method for analyzing an energy landscape represented as a weighted network (Fig. 1). Figure 1. A schematic illustration of ELA. In the energy landscape, the nodes of the network represent unique community compositions, and the links represent the transition paths between them. The community composition is described as a binary vector that represents the presence (1) and absence (0) of a species , and the links connect all nodes that differ only in the presence or absence of one species (Fig. 1B). The nodes are weighted by their energies, and the difference in energy level drives the direction of transitions in community composition (Fig.1D). The energy is assigned by a pairwise maximum entropy model or its extension with an external force (environmental effect) term (Fig.1C). Platforms We currently provided several software platforms for running ELA. rELA ELApy ela (Original Mathematica) R package R package of ELA is currently available on Windows, Mac(including arm64), and Linux.
