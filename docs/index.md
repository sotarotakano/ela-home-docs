# Welcome to ELA doumentation!

## Introduction
Energy landscape analysis (ELA) is a systematic method for analyzing an energy landscape represented as a weighted network (Fig. 1).<br>

- In the energy landscape, the nodes of the network represent unique community compositions, and the links represent the transition paths between them.
- The community composition is described as **a binary vector that represents the presence (1) and absence (0) of a species**, and the links connect all nodes that differ only in the presence or absence of one species (Fig. 1B). 
- The nodes are weighted by their energies, and the difference in energy level drives the direction of transitions in community composition (Fig.1D).
- The energy is assigned by **a pairwise maximum entropy model** or its extension with an external force (environmental effect) term (Fig.1C). 

## Platforms
We currently provided several software platforms for running ELA.

### R package
R package of ELA is currently available on Windows, Mac(including arm64), and Linux.<br>
<br>
The package is not currently distributed via repositories and can be only installed from 
a local file after the download. <br>

**For details see: <https://github.com/kecosz/rELA.>**

### Python package
Python package of ELA is currently available only on Mac(including arm64) or Linux.<br>
<br>
The installation of python package is also not yet supported via online repositories, pip or conda.<br>
The user need to download all the modules from the git repository and need the manual instllation.<br>
